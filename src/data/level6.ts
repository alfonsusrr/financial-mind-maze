Similarly, during the 2019-2020 trade tensions, semiconductor equipment makers outperformed chip designers. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) showed these varying performances, rising 60% in 2019 despite the trade war specifically because of diversification across the semiconductor value chain.",

    title: '🧠 Recency Bias in Climate Investing',
    description: "Recency bias causes investors to overweight recent climate disasters in their decision-making, leading to performance chasing in clean energy stocks and buying thematic ETFs near their peaks after major climate events.",
    background: 'level6/6.mp4',
    realWorldExample: "The pattern is consistent: After Hurricane Katrina, clean energy ETFs surged 40%, only to crash in the financial crisis. Similarly, following Hurricane Sandy, solar stocks jumped 50% before declining 60% when oil prices fell. Most recently, after the Texas freeze that crippled the state's power grid, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) reached an all-time high of $125, only to drop 60% to $50 over the next year despite strong fundamental growth in installations. Each climate disaster creates a temporary surge in interest that often reverts without consistent policy support.",
    summary: "Climate investing works best when approached systematically rather than reactively after disasters. The most successful climate investors build positions consistently over time rather than making large allocations after headline events when valuations are often stretched.",

    title: '🧠 Moral Licensing in Commodity Trading',
    description: "Moral licensing is a cognitive bias where people use their good deeds to justify ethically questionable choices. In investing, this often appears when trading commodities during crises, justifying potential profits from disruptions by promising to use gains ethically.",
    background: 'level6/6.mp4',
    realWorldExample: "Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, natural gas futures spiked 30% as production platforms were damaged. Trading volume in natural gas ETFs quadrupled, with many retail investors citing 'market efficiency' or promises to 'donate some profits' as justification. Research by behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that investors who considered themselves environmentally conscious were actually more likely to trade fossil fuel disruptions than those without such identities, often explaining this contradiction through moral licensing. Similar patterns emerged during the 2021 Texas freeze, where energy trader profits exceeded $50 billion while millions suffered without power.",
    summary: "Recognizing moral licensing helps align investment choices with genuine values. If you're concerned about climate change, directly profiting from climate disasters creates internal cognitive dissonance that justifications rarely resolve satisfactorily.",

    description: "Hyperbolic discounting—valuing immediate emotional relief over future financial outcomes—becomes particularly powerful during crypto market meltdowns, which tend to be more dramatic and media-amplified than traditional market corrections.",
    background: 'level6/6.mp4',
    realWorldExample: "When cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox collapsed, Bitcoin fell 85% and companies with any blockchain connection crashed. AMD and NVIDIA, which had seen demand for GPUs from miners, fell over 40%. Investors who sold these chipmakers based on crypto exposure missed their subsequent 1,000%+ gains over the following years as gaming and data center demand dwarfed crypto mining. History repeated almost exactly during the FTX collapse—semiconductor stocks with partial crypto exposure were indiscriminately sold, creating one of the best buying opportunities in a decade just before the AI computing revolution drove record chip demand.",

Yet within 18 months, NVIDIA surpassed $1,000 per share (pre-split) as AI computing demand exceeded even the most optimistic projections. A similar pattern occurred after the dot-com crash—Amazon fell 95% from its peak, yet long-term investors who recognized the fundamentals of e-commerce eventually saw returns exceeding 50,000% as the company's vision materialized over two decades.",
