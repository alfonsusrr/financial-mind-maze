    description: "Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a powerful psychological bias that drives investors to chase hot trends and IPOs. This emotional reaction is further fueled by the positive skewness of IPO returns ‚Äî the small chance of extraordinary gains that capture our imagination despite the statistically poor average outcomes.",
    background: 'level4/Insight.mp4',
    realWorldExample: "A 2020 study published in the Journal of Financial Economics analyzed 7,487 IPOs from 1975 to 2016 and found that the average IPO underperformed the broader market by 21% over three years. Despite this, investors are drawn to IPOs because of outliers like Amazon (up 76,000% since its IPO) or Microsoft (up 340,000%). Airbnb's 2020 IPO doubled on its first day of trading, reaching a $100+ billion valuation despite the pandemic's impact on travel. Six months later, it had fallen over 40% from its peak as tourism recovery proved slower than investors initially hoped and insiders were allowed to sell shares.",
    summary: "IPOs create the perfect storm of behavioral biases: positive skewness (possibility of jackpot returns), scarcity (limited shares available), social proof (everyone talking about it), and present bias (focus on immediate gains). Despite the allure, research shows that 60-70% of IPOs trade below their offering price within five years, with average long-term returns significantly trailing market indexes.",
